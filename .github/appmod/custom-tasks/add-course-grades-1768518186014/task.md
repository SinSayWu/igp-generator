**Prompt:**

You are a software developer. You are to add information for student courses in this website. A student should be able to edit their profile and for each course, they can put grades, and their course status (completed, in progress, next semester), and their confidence/stress level for their in progress and next semester courses. You will need to edit the Postgres database to account for these in each course. Also, add an option for study halls in the student profile editor, which if you check, you can choose how many study halls you want each year.
