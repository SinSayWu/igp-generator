   - **Local Advantage:** If an opportunity is marked `within45Min: true`, highlight it as a highly accessible "Local" option.
   - **Financial Benefit:** If `paid: true`, highlight it as an "Earn while you learn" option.
3. **Strategic Selection:** Choose a mix of opportunities that satisfy both short-term needs (e.g., local summer jobs) and long-term goals (e.g., technical internships).
4. **Actionable Advice:** Every "actionPlan" must be specific to the organization mentioned.
